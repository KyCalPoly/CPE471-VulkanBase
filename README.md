# CPE471-VulkanBase

**Experimental basecode developed for Cal Poly CPE 471 - Introduction to Computer Graphics.**

---

Due to the continued deprecation of OpenGL and shifting of the CG industry towards explicit API, faculty felt that course materials needed to be reworked. This repository contains an experimental attempt to replace the traditionally OpenGL lab and project basecode's for Cal Poly's CPE 471 course with Vulkan based alternatives. 

Check branches to see the available basecodes.
